    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Driven by a love of building intricate things with my hands and a growing fascination with the world of technology, I'm ready to step beyond the electric panel and into the web development arena. 
        Years spent wielding a screwdriver have honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, while my passion for technology and user experience fuels my desire to craft beautiful, accessible online spaces. 
        Beyond the allure of a new challenge, I yearn for the freedom of remote work, where laptops, not wires, tether me to a desk, allowing more time for the cherished connections with family that life seems to rush past. 
        This shift isn't just a career pivot, it's a journey towards a digital canvas where my electrical expertise meets technological dreams, all under the boundless skies of a flexible, family-centered future.
